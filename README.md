# Tonchi

## 📝 About

Tonchi is a 2D action platformer based on my cat.

This is my first ever game and introduction to software development outside of school. Built using [Unity2D](https://unity.com/) and C#. 
Models and animations made by me using [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), a free open source art application. Music also made by me using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/). 

Credits for the sound effects goes to [SoundBible](https://soundbible.com/).
